I had created a dashboard of my own ecommerce store in which I had gathered the data of 5 months sales..
In This Report , I had presented the following fields;
➡ I had created a slicers by which you can analyze each city sales.
➡ I had created 5 KPI's of Total Orders , Profit / Loss , Delivered Shipments , Return Shipments & Sum of Delivery Charges Amount given to courier.
➡ Design a bar chart of No of orders w.r.t months which help us to forecast in future
➡ Design a column chart of 5 highest profitable cities which help us to do location based target marketing of our product.
